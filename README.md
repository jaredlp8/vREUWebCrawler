# JavaScript Web Crawler

Hello and welcome to my web crawler developed for the CAHSI vREU. This crawler extracts the JavaScript files and headers from a website. In this repository you can
find the results of the websites that I crawled as well as the code of the crawler. 

## Programming Language and Libraries
The crawler was developed in **Python** and used the following libraries: 

- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) 
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
- [Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html)


## How to use crawler
The crawler accepts .txt files containing your desired sites to crawl. You can follow the formatting example list text file provided, examplelist.txt, in the repository 
so that no errors occur during the crawling process.
